**Growth Mindset** 🧠

In this mindset, the hand you're dealt is just the starting point for development. This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Changing our beliefs can have a powerful impact. The growth mindset creates a powerful passion for learning.


+ Mindsets are just beliefs. They’re powerful beliefs, but they’re just something in your mind, and you can change your mind.
+ A growth mindset is the belief that you can develop your talents and abilities with effort, whilst a fixed mindset is the belief that your talents and abilities cannot be improved.
+ People in a growth mindset don’t just seek challenge, they thrive on it.
+ Mindset shift; “I can’t do this.”  -> “I can’t do this YET.” 
+ Becoming is better than being.
