1- What is node.js?
 is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses 
Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.


2- In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

is a javaScript engin anf it is a open source, can run in google 
chrome and in web browsers. it desigend with performance in mind and 
responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code 
that your computer can execute.

3- What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

Node took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such 
as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating 
system–related utility methods.

 Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript 
on our computers.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1- What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
1. Greater efficiency.
2. Engaged collaboration.
3. Learning from fellow students.
4. Social skills.
5. Job interview readiness.
6. Work environment readiness.

2- In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most 
beneficial?

Social skills.
 
3-How does pair programming work?

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly 
involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the 
programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the 
keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the 
text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course 
writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but 
does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator 
thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might 
be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The 
Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to 
look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any 
code.
