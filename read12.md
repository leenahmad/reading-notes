sql | nosql
------------ | -------------
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
SQL databases have predefined schema | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL |  NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb 
SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server.  | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.



2- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

complex query intensive environment

3- Give a real world example.

MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL

4- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose. 

5- Give a real world example.

 MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

6- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

 NoSQL

7- Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL
